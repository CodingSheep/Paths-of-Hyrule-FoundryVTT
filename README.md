# Paths of Hyrule - Foundry VTT Module Implementation
A module implementation of Aoife's *Paths of Hyrule* homebrew: [Player Core](https://scribe.pf2.tools/v/V3PlxT3q-paths-of-hyrule-player-core) [GM Core](https://scribe.pf2.tools/v/5W9RYOpZ-paths-of-hyrule-gm-core)

Currently includes everything as of V1.07 of Paths of Hyrule.

# Requirements
- Foundry V12
- PF2e System Version 6.8.4 or greater
- [PF2e Creature Compendia Version 7.0 or greater](https://github.com/TikaelSol/PF2e-Animal-Companions)

# Installation
- In FoundryVTT, click "Install Module" and at the bottom of the pop-up, input the following Manifest URL:
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodingSheep/Paths-of-Hyrule-FoundryVTT/main/module.json
- You will be prompted to enable/install the PF2e Creature Compendia Module.

# Bug Reports
You may create an issue on the project if you find an issue.

If you need some direct help with the module, you may ping me in Aoife's [community discord server](https://discord.gg/jjgqESQFyd) (Username: CodingSheep)

# Contributing
Anyone is welcome to make a Pull Request for suggested changes or to ping me in the afforementioned community discord server.

# TODO
- Currently, the module uses either default icons for feats or icons for Zelda items found online. Much like the TODO of the previously maintained implementation of this homebrew, I'd love to add custom icons for everything.
